Get ATISS network to generate mesh

TODO:
1. Train ATISS network (on e.g. bedroom scenes)
Goal: 21.11
Alex

2. Voxelize furniture dataset (preprocessing)
Goal: 21.11
no color for now
possible sizes 32^3 64^3
Luis

3. Create Autoencoder network (later variational)
Goal: 25.11 (or earlier)
Alex
similar to https://github.com/kdj842969/3D-Autoencoder

4. Pretrain Autoencoder on voxelized dataset of furniture
Right after 3
Alex

5. Create MLP to replace encoder part of autoencoder
Luis

6. Train MLP using the whole network structure (ATISS => MLP => Decoder) (freeze weights for other networks)
Right after 5
Alex

7. Pray it works
Both :)

Overall Goal:
Sunday 27.11

Visualizations:
Show Autoencoder input/output
Rendered scenes from ATISS
